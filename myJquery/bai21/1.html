			Operating the Bacon Express is cumbersome from moment one. To access the cooking compartment you need to pull on two handles simultaneously and splay open the entire chassis like a book. It's annoying, because once one side releases, you've just lost all of your leverage on the other. But annoying turns to dangerous once the appliance is preheated, or worse: once it's filled with scalding-hot bacon. You'll need to use the heat-safe handles, one on each door, or risk a burn.

Inside the cooking chamber is a vertical heating element, surrounded on all sides by a non-stick, removable cooking plate. You drape your bacon over this plate like you'd dry a towel over a handrail, then let it cook.
